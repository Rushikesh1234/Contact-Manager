# Contact-Manager

Contact Manager App using Nodejs, Express, MongoDB &amp; JWT

I have worked on building a contact manager backend application from scratch which icludes all CRUD operation. User is allowed to register and login to account
And, then User can create, retrieve, update, and delete the contacts using different APIs call which is designed using Express.js. 

I have connected MongoDB database with this application to store and retrieve the contacts.
